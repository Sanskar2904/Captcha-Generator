# Captcha-Generator
A captcha is a way of identifying a user whether the user is human or not.  A captcha is made up with the help of combining letters and digits. it ensures that the user who is trying to access the platform is a human. 
So I created a webpage which shows the captcha matching property whether it is done by human or robot and for that I have added the message so that on correct captcha it returns the message you are not a robot and in case incorrect captcha it shows invalid captcha try again.
